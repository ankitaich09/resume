                      <p>I researched under <b>Prof. Amit Dutta and Dr. Aruna Chakraborty</b> to effectively extract three keywords from domain specific document sets. These were filtered by neural networks for better results. All of the work was done on Python (3.4.3) and MATLAB (2016b) a high level of accuracy was obtained. </p>
