   Hello, welcome to my website. I am Ankit Aich. Currently, I am pursuing my doctorate in <b>Computer Science</b> from the University of Illinois at Chicago.
   <br>My primary area of research is <b>Natural Language Processing</b>. My specific interests lie in the area of figurative speech detection. Primarily, I aim to detect subtle nuances in speech, and figurative language such as humor using sarcasm or metaphor. My resarch has led me to use 
   a variety of both classical and multimodal NLP techniques to achieve my research goals.</br>
   <br>I currently work at the Natural Language Processing Lab at UIC and work under <a href="natalieparde.com">Dr. Natalie Parde</a>, who is my advisor and the co-director of the NLP lab at the University of Illinois at Chicago.</br>
   <br>I also have a variety of other interests, which range from creating and playing music, to teaching, reading books, and practicing martial arts. All of which I try and pursue as I make my way through a very interesting journey called life.</br>
